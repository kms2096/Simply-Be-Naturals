            Hello! My name is Makayla Johnson! After many years of “allergic reactions” and skin irritation, I had ruled out almost every product on the market. From face wash to lotions. This meant that while I didn’t have as much irritation, I didn’t have any of the benefits either. I started learning to make my own products without any of the harsh chemicals and fragrances. I believe everyone should know what is in the products they use on their body and in their home. That’s why I started Simply Be Naturals! I wanted to start a company that sells products with simple, natural ingredients that people don’t have to worry about. Here at Simply Be Naturals, every ingredient has a purpose.
